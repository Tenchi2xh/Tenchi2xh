![](/img/keyboard/header.png)

I always wanted a second mechanical keyboard: for a long time I've had a [Corsair K90](http://www.corsair.com/en-eu/vengeance-k90-performance-mmo-mechanical-gaming-keyboard), which is gaming focused. But for my daily work, I wanted something more oriented towards typing, and in a portable form-factor so that I can bring it to my workplace (I was currently using a wired [Apple keyboard](http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MB110B/B/apple-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-british) but that will just not cut it).

Everyday keyboards provide springiness to their keys by having a large rubber layer, subdivided with [dome shapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Dome-switch_keyboard). The crux of a [mechanical keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard) lies in the fact that each key has its separate mechanical switch, which gives keys more depth and a more satisfying feedback.

## Keyboard choice

There are multiple brands and types of switches. One of the most command brands is [Cherry MX](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX): the K90 has Cherry MX red switches, which have a linear action (pressing the key feels the same all the way). For this new keyboard, I wanted Cherry MX clear switches, which give a tactile *bump* when the switch actuates.

After investigating brands and reading reviews, I found that the folks at [WASD Keyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/) sell robust and portable mechanical keyboards that you can customize in almost every aspects (key colors, layout, form-factor and switches), so it was for me the perfect opportunity to get something unique to me.

For the design, I thought that having completely blank keycaps would be neat since I don't look at them. I also wanted a clean all-black design.

But then I got the idea that using *fictional alphabet* would amount to the same as blank keycaps, with the added benefit of looking nice. So I spent a few (many) nights designing one in [Inkscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape), whenever I found the time.

Being a big fan of Zelda, I went with the Hylian language (in particular the version from [The Wind Waker](http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/hylian2.htm)). Strongly considered alternatives were: [Klingon](http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/klingon.htm), [Tengwar](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tengwar.htm) and the [Standard Galactic Alphabet](http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/sga.htm).

## Designing

Since this alphabet is based around Japanese [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana), I tried my best to mimic the [Japanese keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Japanese) (a few keys had to be swapped around due to the physical layout). The fonts I found around online only contained the glyphs visible in-game, which are the alphabet (46 syllables plus diacritics) and numbers, which left me with all the rest of the symbols to invent for myself.

Here's the layout I came up with:

![The jp-HY layout](/img/keyboard/layout.png)

For the inspiration of the symbols that I had to make up, I was mainly influenced by the Japanese kanjis for up and down, but inverted: `上` and `下`.

I then used those basic arrows to make many variations with double lines or dots for <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>⇧</kbd>, <kbd>⇪</kbd>, <kbd>↹</kbd>, <kbd>⌫</kbd> and <kbd>↵</kbd>.

The <kbd>Esc</kbd> key is a Hylian variation of `止`, the Japanese kanji for "stop".

The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd> and <kbd>Meta</kbd> keys are transcribed from the Japanese spelling of the [three Goddesses](https://zeldawiki.org/Golden_Goddesses) in the mythology of Hyrule: *Din* `ディン`, *Nayru* `ネール` and *Farore* `フロル`.

The remainder of the keys are two-syllables verbs trying to describe what the key is for.

Finally, I branded the keyboard by adding my logo <img class="inline-image" src="/images/hanko.png" /> to the space bar.

And here is the finished product:
