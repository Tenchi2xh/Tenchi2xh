# Me

Programmer from Switzerland, now living in the Netherlands. You can read more about me in my [Introcution](/posts/introduction).

Here is a random list of things I like:

- Text files
- Code golfing
- [The game of Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29) (~5k)
- Customizing *everything*
- Street Fighter
- Python, Scala, Typescript
- Font kerning

Interested in talking about one of these subjects?
